# Vercel + Stytch MCP Server

This repository contains:
- A toy TODO App website built using NextJS
- A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) Server built with [@vercel/mcp-adapter](https://github.com/vercel/mcp-adapter)

User and client identity is managed using [Stytch](https://stytch.com/). Put together, these features show how to extend a traditional full-stack application for use by an AI agent.

This demo uses the [Stytch Consumer](https://stytch.com/b2c) product, which is purpose-built for Consumer SaaS authentication requirements.
B2B SaaS applications should evaluate Stytch's [B2B](https://stytch.com/b2b) product as well.

## Set up

Follow the steps below to get this application fully functional and running using your own Stytch credentials.

Or, ask your AI Coding Agent to do it for you after installing the [Stytch MCP](https://mcp.stytch.dev) 
```bash
Can you help me set up this project? Follow the Agent Setup Instructions in the README.md file.
Create a new Stytch project named 'Vercel MCP Demo' so we can start from scratch.
```

### In the Stytch Dashboard

1. Create a [Stytch](https://stytch.com/) account. Within the sign up flow select **Consumer Authentication** as the authentication type you are interested in. Once your account is set up a Project called "My first project" will be automatically created for you.

2. Navigate to [Frontend SDKs](https://stytch.com/dashboard/sdk-configuration?env=test) to enable the Frontend SDK in Test

3. Navigate to [Connected Apps](https://stytch.com/dashboard/connected-apps?env=test) to enable Dynamic Client Registration and configure your authorization URL as `http://localhost:3000/oauth/authorize`.

4. Navigate to [Project Settings](https://stytch.com/dashboard/project-settings?env=test) to view your Project ID and API keys. You will need these values later.

### On your machine

In your terminal clone the project and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stytchauth/vercel-mcp-example.git
cd vercel-mcp-example
pnpm i
```

Next, create an `.env.local` file by running the command below which copies the contents of `.env.template`.

```bash
cp .env.template .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` in the text editor of your choice, and set the environment variables using the values found on [Project Settings](https://stytch.com/dashboard/project-settings?env=test).

```
# This is what a completed .env.local file will look like
NEXT_PUBLIC_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN=public-token-test-8028777e-6e15-4faa-ba16-26cfd5b3ecb
STYTCH_PROJECT_ID=project-test-6c24cd16-73d5-64f7-852c-8a7e7b2ccf62
STYTCH_SECRET=secret-test-OMITTED
STYTCH_DOMAIN=shrouded-source-1584.customers.stytch.dev
```

## Running locally

After completing all the setup steps above the application can be run with the command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) and the MCP server will be available at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.

Test your MCP server using the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector)
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest
```

Or with [MCP Remote](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote)
```bash
npx mcp-remote http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

MCP Remote can also be used to connect to Claude Desktop or other tools that work with STDIO MCP transports.
```json
"todoapp": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "mcp-remote",
    "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
  ]
}
```

## Agent Setup Instructions

Agents! Goose, Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc. Please follow these steps.

1. Make sure all code dependencies are installed with `pnpm install`
2. Use the `listProjects` tool to find the Project ID of an existing `CONSUMER` `TEST` project. If there are multiple projects, ask the user which one to use. A new project can be created with the `createProject` tool if desired.
3. Use the `updateConsumerSDKConfig` tool to ensure the SDK is enabled, and is authorized to run on `http://localhost:3000`. Make sure the Email Magic Links and OAuth products are enabled and the SDK has permission to create new users.
4. Use the `getAllRedirectURLs` and `createRedirectURLs` tools to ensure `http://localhost:3000/authenticate` is registered as a default callback for `LOGIN` and `SIGNUP` actions.
5. Use the `getAllPublicTokens` and/or `createPublicToken` tools to retrieve the public token for the project. Add it to `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN` using `echo ... >> .env.local`.
6. Use the `createSecret` tool to create a new secret for the project. Add it to `.env.local` as `STYTCH_SECRET` using `echo ... >> .env.local`.
7. Add the `STYTCH_PROJECT_ID` and `STYTCH_DOMAIN` to `.env.local` as well
8. Tell the developer to run `pnpm dev`
